# Eukaryote taxonomic names with DOIs

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/657165102.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/657165102)

Datasets linking eukaryote taxonomic names to DOIs for corresponding publications. The taxonomic names come from Index Fungorum, International Plant Names Index (IPNI) and Index of Organism Names (ION), DOIs, Wikidata QIDs, and bibliographic citations come from [Index Fungorum as a Catalogue of Life Data Package (ColDP)](https://github.com/rdmpage/index-fungorum-coldp), [International Plant Names Index (IPNI) as a Catalogue of Life Data Package (ColDP)](https://github.com/rdmpage/ipni-coldp), and [BioNames as a Catalogue of Life Data Package (ColDP)](https://github.com/rdmpage/bionames-coldp). See [Ten years and a million links: building a global taxonomic library connecting persistent identifiers for names, publications and people](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.29.542697) for background to this work.

## Data

The data is provided in the form of tab-delimited (TSV) files, one for each of Index Fungorum, IPNI, and ION. Each file is sorted either by taxonomic name or identifier, and the ID column includes a database-specific prefix, so you could combine all the data into a single database if you wish.

The data is provided here is a subset of the data in the above projects (for example, it only includes publications with DOIs, ignoring other persistent identifiers). The data is likely to contain errors, and may be behind the individual projects.
